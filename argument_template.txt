In this argument, the author advocates that MID. Although this seems reasonable at first glance, it is de facto misguided. The reasons are stated as follows.

Firstly, the author assumes that F1. Albeit this is entire possible, the arguer does not offer valid evidence to substantiate this crucial assumption. It is very likely that R1 happens. An example is not very far to seek: E1. The author's reasoning is thereby flawed unless he or she could convincingly rule out the other possible scenarios.

In addition, the author takes it for granted that F2. It is not guaranteed that this is necessarily the case and the arguer does not supply any reliable evidence to support this assumption. It is quite possible that R1. To illustrate my point, let us take a look at the representative example. E2. Without accounting for eliminating, it is inadequate for the arguer to bolster his or her point.

The last but not the lest, even if the evidence turns out to support the foregoing assumptions, the author simply assumes that F3 and not any conclusive scientific evidence is provided to affirm this assumption. It is reasonable to doube that what this arguer assumes will not happen i realty. It is just as possible that R3. For example, E3. To reach the cited conclusion, the argues must explain why none of these alternatives is able to sustain. 

In conclusion, the argument mentioned above is not based on valid evidence or sound reasoning, both of which are necessary and dispensable for a conclusive argument. In order to draw a better conclusion, the author should reson more convincingly, cite more persuasive evidence and take every possible consideration/ alternative explanation into account.
