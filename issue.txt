    3. Uniformly enhance the education over the entire nation. 
  Cons:
    1. People are different from each other. They have their own interest and the same curriculum will be detrimental to their growth. (Students could develop their interest outside the class).
    3. *** In countries where there are diverse cultures, the same national curriculum is not a must and in different areas, curriculum should be chosen delicately and meticulously. 
  In conclusion, we should not make sweep generalizations. In a nation that the cultures there are distinctive culture diversity. 

49. Claim：We can usually learn
Pros:
  1. Disagreement is a way of engendering critical thinking. Meditating on contradictory views helps you to achieve the correct answer, when your point of view is initially errornous as a whole or in part. Human beings are de facto not perfect and our views are flawed more or less. 
  2. Disagreement reflects democracy. People who share their views with us might be forced to doing so. In other words, their original thought is entirely contradictory to ours but they deliberately change their point of view when discussing because they are inferior to us status and therefore seek to flatter us. In that case, our discussion will not generate authetic and constructive results owing to the fact that the discussion is in essence toadism.
  3. *** Disagreement is the social requirements. You have to cooperate with others. Although disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning, as a human being in the society, one must grip the chance to learn how to reconcile with others. 
Cons:
  1. Disagreement may lead to an unnecessary quarrel and shift their focus into argument instead of discussion.
In conclusion:

40. Claim：When planning courses
Pros:
  1. Students are more motivated to learn when they are interested in what they are studying.
  2. Students interest reflects the frontier of their studied field. (Cloud computing & Big data).
  3. Students absorb knowledge actively instead of passively, teaching what they are not interested in leads to passive learning, which is in essence an infusion of knowledge and is not beneficial to their understanding.
Cons:
  1. The knowledge system and structure cannot be modified or impaired.
  2. Their interest fluctuates and changes frequently.
  3. Doing so imposing the burdens on educators.
In conclusion: Compulsory courses and elective courses.
  Combind their original course and students interest.

3. Educational institutions have
Pros:
  1. Investment is more likely to get wasted
  2. Help student to find a job when they graduate
Cons:
  1. Reflects Students' interest
  2. Fields of study unlikely to succeed is of greater significance. Math, Physics
  3. It is hard to predict which field of study is unlikely to succeed
In conclusion:
  Educational insitution should enact different policies for different students

45、Competition for high grades
Pros:
  1. Study or revise what is included or covered in the exam
  2. Competition leads to stress.
  3. Competition does not fully reflect the quality of studying
  4. Result of research
Cons:
  1. Competition enhances their motives
  2. Competition is a standard fair to students

  It has been an existing tradition problem

24、The best way to teach
Pros:
  1. Praise postive actions helps forming a good habit.
  2. Praise postive actions sets the paradigm
  3. Understand better in a comfortable environment.
Cons:
  1. One may get too proud that the sense of achievement and appraisement will gradually fade away. To keep that sense, educator should intensify the praisement. 
  2. Neglection of negative actions may result in repition of negative actions.
In conclusion:
  They should be evaluated and treatedly respectively.

12、Free University Education
Pros:
  1、Free education secures them to study and thus beneficial to their development. Talents
  2、It is a demonstration of fairness.
  3、Improve competition.
Cons:
  1、Governments should consider their affordability if they are able to offer a free university education.
  2、Reduction of tuition fee is also applicable.
  3、Use scholarship to movitate might be a better way.
In conclusion:

30、Teachers Salaries:
P:
  1、Academic performance reflects their teaching level

  3、Correct their behaviors in school.
C:
  1、Young -> Okay; Old -> Independance.
  2、Should be respectively treated according to their work load
I:
  Coercion is not sensible. Only dealt with properly, the advantage overweigh the disadvantages.


48、Educators should teach facts
P:
  1、Based on the idea, trends, and concepts that, student construe the facts better. Study is a gradual process. Motivation for students
  2、Easier for educators to teach. Increase the complexity for explaining the facts. Move into discussion faster.
C:
  1、It takes a long time for students to study the ideas. Their view is likely to be biased when they learn by themsevles.
  2、It is hard for educators to decide what time is appropriate to tell them the facts.
  3、Students are misguided easily.
M: Although C, students should be told the facts. They are easily to be misguided by mass media and public opinion.
I: If appropriate measures taken, the advantages outweighs the disadvantages.

17、Formal education tends to

  1、Formal education use standards to evaluate the students ability, which restrain their spirits. Formal education stiffen
  2、Its purpose is utilitarianism, which prepare them for their future jobs. 
C:
  1、Formal education covers the basic knowledge for individuals. Creativity is based on the building blocks.
  2、Freedom of spirits relies on individuals themselves instead of the education they received(E.g: Club, After-school activities, Research Lab)
M:
  1、Although some talents are better cultivated by specialized education mode, most
  2、It is inappropriate to ascribe the loss of creativity to formal education.
I:
  Although the effect formal education should be furthur discussed, I believe that the formal education is ultimately to emanicipate the freedom of their spirits.

123、The best way for a society to prepare
P:
  合作有助于形成合力，走向成功(leadership needs to be cooperative, reconcile conflicts)。
  合作有助于减小压力(helps reduce their stress)。
C:
  竞争有助于提高个人素质(improve their own quality)
  合作容易缺乏主见（lose their own thought)

  竞争和合作are both of great significance.
  Leadership requires not only a sense of cooperation and competition, but also a clear and logic mind, a strong will to renovate.

58、Learning is primarily a matter of
P:
  1. Learning is a matter that lasts a lifetime. It is not easy for an individual to resist the temptation outside.
  2. Psycologically, only students with a strong will could be motivated. School or college provides a study environment and other facilities. Coercion is of no avail.
C:
  3. School and college motivates the students when they are young. Such as primary school students.
  4. Competition in school and college is also a conspicuous source of motivation. 
M:
  Also from their parents. 
  Although is going to be further discussed, it is more persuasive of the position that learning is indeed a matter of personal discipline.

101、Although innovations such as

4. Competition. Make new friends. 
不要In conclusion

42、Students should always
P:
  1. Question could be categorized as critical thinking, which helps student form their own point of view.
C:
  1. Students in primary school should accept those basic knowledge, even if they have to accept it passively. Axioms
  2. antagonism result from always questioning. Students should try first to understand what they are taught. The process of understand already takes a considerable amount of time and energy. Try to collect strong evidence to oppose or support the statements they are faced with. Always questioning regardless of what they are taught is not helpful and beneficial to their learning and waste both their energy and time while interrogation with powerful and persuasive reasoning deepens their comprehension of knowledege. E.g. Math proof.
I:
  The efficiency and utility of questioning should be further discussed in the future. Interrogation, to certain degree, is beneficial to their study and is the source of creativity, based on the deep comprehension of materials the students are presented with. But it is clear to see that always questioning is more likely to result in adverse results, including suspension of their study and profligation of their time.

37、Society should identify
P:
   Society could provide opportunities for talents at an early age. Thus to cultivate them in a better environment suitable for them. E.g. My friend Fiona embraces an IQ over 150 and she was selected as candidate. She is now pursuing her PhD degree in Physics. 
C:
   It is hard to predict and identify those children who have special talents will continue to show their genius when they have grown up. Many talented person, as a matter of fact, did not show their talents when they were young. An appropriate example is not far to seek. Steve Jobs dismissed from Reed College at the age of 21 and instituted Apple Incoporated Company with his partners. His well-known iMac made its debut in 1997 and the era of mobile internet when he launched his new product iPhone began in 2007. Steve Jobs is a talent whose capability was not recognized at an early age. Therefore, there may not be special need for society to identify those children granted with special talents.

   Society should provide equal opportunities of education for all of us and invest more on the mass education to enhance the overall quality of education, based on the fact that most of us do not embrace any special or outstanding talent while the talented are only in minority. The overall quality of education and civilization reflects the strength of a society  and the effect of social progress. On the other hand, investment on those talents is gambling and their success are not secured, it is more stable and guaranteed to improve the mass education.

   Identification of those children with special talents and providing training for them is not a must, although this issue is still a controversial issue and should be furthur discussed. When the appropriate policies is taken and applied in the future, both talents and common people will find their own ways to success.

73、Colleges and universities should
   P:
   overall quality, expand their horizons, interdisciplinary achievements. Put into practice.

   Faculties with interests should .. To aggressive, Otherwise a waste of time, suspend their own work.
   
   For some majors like Maths or Physics, academic research is energy cosuming.

142、Claim：Colleges and universities should
   Reason is biased:
     University is a place of freedom. College students are different from Creativity: Steve Jobs.
   Claim is also biased:
     Eliminating courses may reduce the stress of teaching but is not beneficial to the diversification of teaching. 
     Relaxing
     For those who want to transfer their major.

     A clear guidance could be provided by well-rounded individuals

54、In order to become well-rounded individuals
  1. intrigues their imagination and enrich their lives.
  2. people have their own interest
  3. that takes a lot of time and teaching resources are limited.
  3. combination of compulsory and elective courses.

举例: For instance, illustration
因为: in order, on account of, thus, consequently, lead to, result in

33. 
 People are of curiosity. When people have made progress to discover a brand new field, they find themselves disoriented and ignorant.
 It is the process of exploration, Things that seems incomprehensible can be deciphered in the future and that is where human beings are.
 More knowledge result in more advanced knowledge, which changes the world.

36.
  Government investments are limited. Besides research, education, medical treatment. So in order to better utilize the investments on research.
  It is hard to predict the consequences of scientific research
  Research whose consequences that are unclear may be of great significance.
  Goverments are of more capability to fund research. In the case, investment at the initial part, then reassess the consequence of research.

1.
  For those people that are lazy. Write love letters. Copy.
  Tech changes the world, human interactions are better facilitated. Social networks
  Tech also accelerate the flow of information. Research
  Depends on how we use this.
2.
  Medicine. Vaccine for Bird flu era.
  Self interest. Explore the world. Mathematics. Physics. 
  Now unlikely. likely in the future. Like weapons.

132.
  Stay indoor. Watching computer on the internet.
  Join after-school activities. Using network as a platform
  Depends on how you use it. For different people at different age, they use technology. E.g. My grandparents

131.
  1. Reason: Almost positive. If the research outcome is predictable, comparatively it is not of great significance.
  2. Claim: Curiosity-oriented may not be of immediate, practical application. While mission-oriented will. The interest of researchers themselves.
  3. Math is the building blocks of other majors and is applied

  The minds of beginners are less constricted. Often at a young age, beginners are more likely to be driven by curiosity while those experts, may driven by the tenure or fame. Louis de Broglio is one of illustrations of this point of view. He used to learn history, philosophy and law as an undergraduate. After he resigned from the army, he began his life as a doctor of philosophy in physics. He was indeed an beginner at that time but he discovered the wave-particle duality of light which is an advanced notion at that time. Many scholars disapprove his discovery when his results were released to the academics but Eistein and Schrodinger acknowledged his work. At the age of 32, Louis de Broglio has made significant contributions to the physics world.
  However, the experts are still the majority to make great contributions. They are rich in knowledge and have devoted more time to conducting experiments. Thus, the experts are more experienced and more likely to make achievements. Roentgen discovered X-ray at his fifties. Without his outstanding of skill of experiments, the striking discovery could not be possible. 'Chances favored only the prepared mind'
  Experts also make their contributions by cultivating the beginners. The courses we learn at universities are designed elaborately and taught patiently by professors, who are experts in their field of study. 

9.
  Isaac Newton, If i have seen furthur, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. Based on the past achievements, we are more likely to make significant contributions. 
  Indulging ourselves in the past achievements, beginners are difficult to stretch their wings and demonstrate their innovations. John von Neumann proposed his computer architecture to treat the instructions and data as a whole. In a brand new or currently advanced field of study, like Computer Science, researchers make contributions not only by creativity, but also by borrowing ideas from others.
  It is too aggressive to make a sweep generalization that it is impossible to make significant contributions without being influenced by past achievements within that field. For those mature fields, such as Mathematics. One should learn from the past and study the basic theories in order to make greater achievements. For those new fields of study, like Computer Science.

143.
  When incorporates, interdisciplinary achievements can be made. They would introduce creativity; resolve problems in a different way. Linguistics and Computer Science.
  Study in their field study helps them to focus. University students receive general education. Although help them become better citizen.
  In new fields of study, borrowing ideas is important. For those fundatmental science, preserverence and diligence matters, Shing-Tung Yao, a illustrious Mathematician.

56.
  "Chances favor the prepared mind."
  Roentgen X-ray;
  Shing-Tung Yau: preserverence and diligence.
  We should not do research with a fluke mind. We should pay attention to every detail instead of hoping XX and doing nothing.

23.
  Scientific research and development has its independence. Governments interference would hinder the development. Professors and researchers should be curiosity-oriented, follow their own way. If they are mission-oriented, the paper and research results the proposed would not be of high quality and of great significance. Sometimes, they are only the results of perfunctoriness and they are more likely to flatter and satisfy the governments' need.
  Governments should restrict on scientific research on controversial. nuclear weapon.
  For those scientific research that are not promising. Governments should establish an assessment system.

64.
  Machine are human's invention. They are operated by human. John von Neumann devise the architecture.
  Machine facilities human's life. Robots help the disabled. They are not only tools, but also friends.
  Machine are also of intelligence. The terminology in computer science is artificially intelligence. Deep blue challege's the chess champion. They are the result of human intelligence. 
  It is hard to predict whether the human mind will be superior to machine.

91.
  Technology increases people's efficiency.
  Technology also provides new way of communication, cures diseases, entertainment, artificial scene. 
  Some people like working while some are not that perserverent or diligent. The development and growth of individual is more important than the amount of leisure time.

26.
  People now indulge themselves in entertainment. inertia arise. no longer solves new problems.
  Still, researchers use the advanced technology to study and innovate. The conveniences of contemporary life helps them focus on their work.
  The luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life For those developing countries, such as China and India, where fierce competition exists.

43. 
  The increasingly repid pace. Utilitarianism. People are eager to achieve success that they are seek any possibility to walk on the shortcuts. Stress.
  The increasingly rapid pace reflects the increasing level of life. People now can enjoy different cultures and entertain themselves. 
  For developing contries, the rapid pace is embodied in the intensive competition.
